Use of Digital Widgets, TextLabels, and ProgressBar (designed in Workshop4)

⚙️ Assumptions:
Workshop4 exported widgets to _4DUIN~1.dat and _4DUIN~1.gci

Widget indexes:

Digital Number Display → DIGIT_TIMER (index 0)

Progress Bar → PROGRESS (index 1)

Activity Label Text → LABEL_STATUS (index 2)

Button connected to pin 2 for activity trigger

Start/reset button on pin 3

You can customize these indexes to match your project.

📦 Workshop4 Requirements
Ensure your ViSi project contains:

A Digital Numeric Display named DIGIT_TIMER

A Progress Bar named PROGRESS

A Static Text Label named LABEL_STATUS

These should be exported using File > Export and saved to SD card as .dat, .gci, and .txt (optional .ini).
